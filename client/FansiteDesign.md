whole site:
font change (please suggest fonts)

### Projects

nav bar no longer drop down
show most recent project on landing
add button to show and link to the pages of other projects (worked too much on the css to scrap it)

### Timeline

actualy timeline in middle with points left and right for significant dates
timeline starts from current date backwards

### Fan Corner

not sure what to do for fan arts, a carousel of imgs?
not sure what to do for fan messages
toggle button to show only arts/messages/both ?
format the message so they are inside a marshmallow?
format the img so a SSRBmin is displaying it inside its mouth?

### About Us

not sure if this should be included in fan corner or its own thing
